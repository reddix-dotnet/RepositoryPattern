# Repository Pattern in .NET Core 8

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Repository Pattern in a .NET Core 8 application. The Repository Pattern is a popular design pattern used to separate the logic that retrieves data from the logic that maps it to the business domain model. It promotes clean code architecture and ensures maintainability and testability.

## Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between data access and business logic.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses .NET Core's built-in dependency injection framework.
- **Unit of Work**: Ensures atomicity and manages multiple repositories.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Fully asynchronous data access methods using `async` and `await`.
- **Entity Framework Core Integration**: Supports EF Core for database operations.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Follows SOLID principles and clean architecture.
